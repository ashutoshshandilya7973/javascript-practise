/** 1. Set up an empty array to store the values that will be calculated within the 
loop.
 2. Create a loop that runs 10 times, incrementing by 1 each time, creating two 
values each iteration. For the first value, multiply the value of the loop count 
by 5. For the second value, multiply the value of the loop counter by itself.
 3. Create a function that returns the value of the two parameters passed into the 
function when it is called. Add the values together, returning the result.
 4. Within the loop, call the calculation function, passing in the two values as 
arguments into the function and storing the returned result in a response 
variable.
 5. Still within the loop, push the result values into the array as it iterates 
through the loop.
 6. After the loop is complete, output the value of the array into the console.
 7. You should see the values [0, 6, 14, 24, 36, 50, 66, 84, 104, 126] for 
the array in the console */
